# JeoTool

Have you ever wanted to create an easy jeopardy game? Well, now you can with the new jeopardy creation tool, JeoTool! With this tool, you're able to easily design, create, and play multiple games at once!

**Account Creation**

> This tool provides the best security features to keep your passwords and personalized data safe using bcrypt. By creating an account, you have access to saved projects, creation to new projects, and much more!

**Layout Design**

> A great way to start out with your jeopardy game is being able to pick the amount of categories/questions you'd like!

**Editing Toolbar**

> One of my favorite features to this project is the ability to update your game in real time. With this ability, you're able to save while designing. To activate your edit toolbar, all you have to do is toggle edit and click on any button or category name.

**Saving Projects**

> There are three ways to update your project:

1. Clicking on the update button
2. Clicking on another column to edit
3. Clicking the X button on the top right of the edit bar.

**Self Made Api/Backend Service**
